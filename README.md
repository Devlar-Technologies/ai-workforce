## 🎯 Example Executions

### Research & Analysis
```python
execute_goal("Research top 5 AI automation trends for 2025")
```
**Result**: Comprehensive market analysis with competitor insights, trend forecasting, and opportunity identification.

### Product Development
```python
execute_goal("Design user onboarding flow for SaaS platform")
```
**Result**: Complete user journey mapping, wireframes, technical specifications, and implementation roadmap.

### Marketing & Sales
```python
execute_goal("Create content strategy and lead generation campaign for enterprise software")
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### CEO Orchestrator (`main.py`)
- Goal decomposition and pod selection
- Budget management and approval workflows
- Quality control and retry logic
- Memory integration for continuous learning

### Wave-Based Execution
```python
# Example: Product Launch Campaign
Wave 1: Research pod → Market analysis
Wave 2: Product pod → Feature specifications
Wave 3: Marketing pod → Launch strategy (depends on Wave 1+2)
Wave 4: Sales pod → Outreach sequences (depends on Wave 3)
```

### Memory System (`memory.py`)
- Vector embeddings for experience storage
- Similarity search for relevant past executions
- Continuous learning and performance improvement
- Pinecone integration with local fallback

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Real-Time Dashboards
- **Workforce Overview** - Active executions, success rates, daily costs
- **Pod Performance** - Execution times, queue sizes, error rates
- **Cost Monitoring** - Budget tracking, API usage, projections
- **System Health** - Uptime, memory usage, external API status

### Automated Alerts
- Budget threshold exceeded ($50+ requires approval)
- High failure rates or performance degradation
- External API outages or rate limits
- System resource constraints

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py --all

# Quick test suite
python tests/run_tests.py --quick

# Unit tests with coverage
python tests/run_tests.py --unit --coverage

# Integration tests
python tests/run_tests.py --integration
```

### Test Coverage
- **Memory System**: Storage, retrieval, cleanup
- **Pod Execution**: All 6 pods with mocking
- **Tool Integration**: External API mocking
- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus integration
- **CEO Orchestrator**: Goal decomposition, budgeting
