# Quick Start Guide

Get your AI Workforce up and running in under 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- API keys for required services (see setup guide below)

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alanomeara1/ai-workforce.git
cd ai-workforce

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Quick Test (Local)

```bash
# Run example execution locally
python examples/execute_goal.py
```

This will run in simulation mode to test the system without API keys.

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### 1. Modal.com Setup

```bash
# Install Modal CLI
pip install modal

# Create account and login
modal token new

# Deploy the workforce
modal deploy deploy/modal_deploy.py
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

**Required API Keys:**
```bash
# Core LLMs
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Memory system
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_key

# Tools
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
APOLLO_API_KEY=your_apollo_key
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_firecrawl_key
INSTANTLY_API_KEY=your_instantly_key
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token

# Interfaces
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_token
```

### 3. Test Installation

```bash
# Quick system test
python examples/execute_goal.py
```

## 🎯 First Execution

### Option A: Direct Execution (Easiest)

```bash
# Execute a goal directly
python -c "from main import execute_goal; print(execute_goal('Research AI automation trends'))"
```

### Option B: Example Script

```bash
# Run interactive examples
python examples/execute_goal.py
```

### Option C: Production (Modal.com)

```bash
# Test on Modal after deployment
modal run deploy/modal_deploy.py::test_execution
```
